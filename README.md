# Learning_BERT


Learning Bert is a personal project that is intended to discover and learn new possibilities in this era. 

More intuitively targeted for my own learning and improvement, I am have been looking ways to build a Artificial Intelligence to suffice my own start project. 

Technologies like BERT that stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers from Google is one of the state of the art pre-training model. 

For more information please visit : <a href = "https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html" target = "_blank"> this page <a> and learn more about it. 
  
I will be using different technologies most likely python to build this project. 

You are most welcome to pull and edit this project.
